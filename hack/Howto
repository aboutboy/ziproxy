Currently, we need only the flashhack_all, which can be used as:

insmod ./flashhack_all.ko proxyip=192.168.56.101 minport=10000 maxport=60000

Changes: since the lvs has changed the dport to the real port which ziproxy
is listening, change the logic in two ways:

insmod ./flashhack_all.ko proxyip=192.168.56.101 proxyport=8000
insmod ./flashhack_all.ko proxyip=192.168.56.101 minport=10000 maxport=60000
