flashhack_http.c: get the dport from tcph, and and modify the HTTP header to add the port info
                : should work on the NF_INET_LOCAL_IN charin, with NF_IP_PRI_MANGLE priority

flashhack_tcp.c : hack the TCP packet, if tcph->urg is not set, use the tcph->urg_ptr to save dport
                : should work on the NF_INET_PRE_ROUTING charin, with NF_IP_PRI_MANGLE priority

flashhack_all.c : hack the TCP packet HTTP request, if TCP packet starts with "GET ", then replace
                  the "HTTP/" with pport(proxy port)

Problems: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. the HTTP request with the port info has been sent to ziproxy, which gets rid of the "XPort: 12345"
   line and forwards it to the www server. And it's verified the HTTP GET request has got handled
   by the web server and ziproxy has got the reply. But the web browser doesn't dispaly the page
   correctly. 
   While using with NAT, the response packet can not be delived to the web browser since the TCP
   SEQ has been adjusted. Use the flashhack_all instead in this case.

2. flashhack_tcp.c is used to hack the TCP packet to provide the dport info, but it still crashs
   the OS. 
   Solved, NULL pointer reference
